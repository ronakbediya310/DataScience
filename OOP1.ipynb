    "Ans:\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It is a programming construct that encapsulates data (attributes) and functions (methods) related to a specific entity or concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the class, representing a specific entity with its own unique state and behavior. Objects are created from classes, and each object can have its own set of values for the attributes defined in the class.\n"

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "Ans:In object-oriented programming (OOP), self is a convention used to refer to the instance of a class within the class's methods. It is a reference to the object itself and allows the methods to access and manipulate the object's attributes and other methods. The use of self helps in distinguishing between instance variables and local variables within a class."

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "Ans:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties (attributes and methods) from another class. The class that inherits is called the subclass or derived class, and the class being inherited from is called the superclass or base class. Inheritance promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n"

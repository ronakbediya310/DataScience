    "Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on representing essential features and behavior of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows us to create classes and objects that capture the essence of real-world entities, while abstracting away the complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class serves as a blueprint for other classes and cannot be instantiated itself. It defines common attributes and methods that subclasses must implement. An interface, on the other hand, defines a contract that classes must adhere to by implementing its methods."

    "Abstraction focuses on representing the essential features and behavior of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows us to create abstract classes or interfaces that define common attributes and methods that subclasses must implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is about bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. It ensures that the internal representation and behavior of an object are hidden from the outside world, and access to the object's data is controlled through well-defined methods. Encapsulation promotes data integrity and provides a way to enforce restrictions on how the data is accessed and modified."

    "Consider a Person class that has attributes like name, age, and email. Encapsulation would involve defining private attributes (prefixed with an underscore, e.g., _name) and providing public methods (getters and setters) to access and modify these attributes. The private attributes are encapsulated within the class, and external code can only interact with them through the defined methods. This way, the internal representation of a person's data is protected, and the class can enforce any necessary validation or logic before allowing modifications."

    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "Ans:In Python, the abc module provides the infrastructure for creating abstract base classes (ABCs). An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is intended to be subclassed by other classes. It serves as a blueprint for defining common interfaces and behaviors that subclasses must implement.\n",
